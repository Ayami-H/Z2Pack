Chirality of a Weyl point (:math:`\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}`)
=============================================================

In this example, a :math:`\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}` model for a Weyl point is set up by explicitly specifying its hamiltonian. 

Using a spherical surface around the Weyl point (``k=[0, 0, 0]``),
the chirality of the point (Chern number of the surface) can be calculated.
