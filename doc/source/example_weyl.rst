Chirality of a Weyl point (tb)
==============================

In this example, a local tight-binding model for a Weyl point is
set up by explicitly specifying its hamiltonian. 

Using a spherical surface around the Weyl point (``k=[0, 0, 0]``),
the chirality of the point (Chern number of the surface) can be calculated.
