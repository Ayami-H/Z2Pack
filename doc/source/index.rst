.. title:: Overview

.. warning :: This site contains the documentation for an upcoming release of Z2Pack. As such, it is still incomplete. Please refer to the documentation of the `current version <http://z2pack.ethz.ch/doc>`_ instead.


Z2Pack is a tool for calculating the Z2 topological invariant. It can be
used either in combination with a first-principles calculation or by
defining a tight-binding model.

For the tight-binding functionality, an `online interface <http://z2pack.ethz.ch/online/>`_ is also
available, however it does not support the full range of options
available in Z2Pack.

If you use Z2Pack or its online interface for your research, please
consider citing it (not yet published).
