Welcome!
========
Z2Pack is a tool for calculating the Z2 topological invariant. It can be
used either in combination with a first-principles calculation or by
defining a tight-binding model.

For the tight-binding functionality, an `online interface <http://z2pack.ethz.ch/online/>`_ is also
available, however it does not support the full range of options
available in Z2Pack.

If you use Z2Pack or its online interface for your research, please
consider citing :ref:`TODO<not_found>`
