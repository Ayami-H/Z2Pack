Tutorial
========
The following Tutorial gives an introduction to the Z2Pack **Python** package. The :ref:`Documentation<core>` of Z2Pack provides more detailed information about the classes, methods and available parameters.

In the first section, the two classes :class:`System<z2pack.System>` and :class:`.Surface` will be introduced, and the different options for calculating, saving, plotting etc. are shown. The subsequent sections explain the two different specialisations, for first-principles calculations or for use with a
tight-binding model.
