.. _VASP:

A first-principles calculation with VASP
========================================
The following is a very basic calculation of Z2 invariants using **VASP** for Bismuth. The complete example (including input files)
can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/Z2PackDev/Z2Pack/tree/master/examples/fp/Bi_vasp>`_.

The potential file ``POTCAR`` is not included in the example because it
is subject to VASP's license.
