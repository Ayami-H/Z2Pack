2.1 Changes
-----------

- Added fp.kpoint.wannier90_nnkpts and fp.kpoint.wannier90_full
- In fp.System's input_files, and file_names, it is now required that the input is a list of strings (previously, a single string was also allowed).
- Default saving is now JSON (change due to fsc.iohelper). Quiet loading doesn't ignore when the file ending is absent or serializer is not set.
