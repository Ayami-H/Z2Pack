TODO for 3.0.0 (restructuring)
==============================

Whether this will ever be implemented fully is to be determined. It's both quite a bit of work and breaks existing code (heavily).

- create classes LineResult, SurfaceResult, System, Surface, Line
- create free functions (run), run_surface, run_line, wcc_plot, chern_plot, z2, chern, ...
- run takes a System and Surface/Line and returns a Result
- runs have an internal state for the current working copy (which is not in SurfaceResult, LineResult format), and a create_result function
- Result descriptor inherits from System and Surface descriptors
- pfile / load / start_result kwargs in run: for save/reload, check descriptor
  for consistency
- maybe pass saving as a function -> multiple possible file types
...
