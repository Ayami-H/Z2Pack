"""
Core functionality of Z2Pack used for calculating the topoligical \
invariants and Wannier charge centers. The Core library interfaces to \
the different specialisations, which create overlap matrices. \
It contains the classes Z2PackSystem (which acts as hook for the \
specialisations) and Z2PackPlane (responsible for all the calculation / \
plots etc.)
